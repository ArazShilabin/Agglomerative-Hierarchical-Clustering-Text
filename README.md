- Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering for Text Data
- Time Complexity: O(n^2*d+n^3)
- Later I realized I could do O(n^2*d+n^2*logn) using priority_queue but it was too late, I'll implement it later when I get the chance :)
- How to run: see the main_test part in the code, I've described every step, enjoy :)
